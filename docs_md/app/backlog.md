# Backlog

This is more of a personal backlog just to plot the required tasks for the project, not necessarily something that follows Agile/SCRUM principles.

Check the `Issues` tab on Github or the `Zenhub` tab to see which issues/tasks were resolved.

## Setup

- run create-react-app Typescript
- moving of files
- install react-router-dom, SCSS & other dependencies
- set project directory structure (docs, frontend, backend)
  - frontend create-react-app with Typescript
  - backend koa with Typescript (probably using manual installation)
  - markdown files should be organized
- Install Redux (good for scaling)
- MERN backend for API implementation

//TODO: some of these can be broken down into smaller tasks

## Typescript Stuff

- keep in mind type definition files for each package installed
- try to be explicit if possible when declaring types (even if Typescript infers or gives no warning)
- try to make type aliases and interfaces as re-usable as possible
- try to make the imports and exports organized (aggregate if needed)
- Typescript for React pages
- Typescript for React components
- Typescript for Redux (warning: a lot of boilerplate code)
- Typescript for Koa

## Presentation

- Create skeleton layout that shows the list of toy images on a page
- skeleton layout for toy page

## User Interactions

- CUD buttons for users to interact with data
- CUD forms for toys for input submission to the backend
- toy action creators
- toy reducers
- error action creators
- error reducers
- loaders for anytime async processes occur

## ??

## Backend

- add koa boilerplate
- Typescript configuration for backend
- Joi validation
- add routes for Toy CRUD

### Backend testing

- jest and supertest configuration
- setup local testing database
- seed data for testing purposes
- add tests for backend API endpoints
- try to use triangulation method as much as possible

### Backend development

- add controller functions for each route
- add error handling for each endpoint
-
