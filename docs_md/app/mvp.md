## Overview

<!-- //TODO:  temporary and can be changed, this is not the final overview-->

This application is an online toy gallery for users to showcase their action figures, figurines, plastic model kits, and so on.

## Must-haves (main requirements of the test)

The application must:

- display a list of toys on a page
- display a specific toy on a page
- sort and nested sort the list of toys on the page
- filter toys based on meta properties
- allow the user to:
  - create a toy page
  - update their own toy pages
  - delete their own toy pages
  - upload images of their toys inside a toy page
  - choose a main "highlight" image to use
- store any created and updated data in a database
- retrieve data from the database and
- change the state on the client side after retrieval
- all features/functionalities' endpoints should be ran through automated tests
- frontend should be tested as well

## Should-haves (additional, optional features)

The application should:

- have authentication:
  - only logged in users can create a toy page
  - both logged in and unauthenticated users can view the list of toys and a specific toy page
- allow users to interact with others' toy pages:
  - provide comments to a user's page
